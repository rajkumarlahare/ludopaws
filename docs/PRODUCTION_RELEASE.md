# LudoProof Production Release Checklist

LudoProof is a production-oriented release candidate. The game backend is authoritative and the Android client cannot select the dice outcome, event index, legal move, capture result, turn advancement, or winner.

## Release gates

A release must not be promoted unless all of these are true:

1. GitHub Actions is green for the exact release commit.
2. Server unit/integration tests pass.
3. Wrangler production dry-run passes.
4. Android JVM unit tests and `lintRelease` pass.
5. Android debug/release APK variants and the release AAB assemble successfully.
6. SHA-256 release evidence is generated for the exact release artifacts.
7. Cloudflare `GET /ready` returns HTTP 200.
8. `ENTRONEX_API_TOKEN` and `LUDOPROOF_SESSION_HMAC_KEY` exist only as Cloudflare Secrets.
9. The pinned EntroNex Ed25519 key ID, tenant ID, fingerprint, and public key match the independently verified trust material.
10. The Android APK/AAB contains no EntroNex customer credential or signing secret.
11. The game Worker remains isolated from Rekixo/AR3D routes.
12. A real-device multiplayer smoke test covers create, join, start, commit, reveal, move, reconnect, timeout recovery, win, and proof/history display.
13. The final store/upload-signed Android artifact is signed outside the repository with the controlled release key.
14. A fresh-install real-device test verifies guest creation/recovery, Google link/restore, account switching, server wallet/inventory, and a two-device multiplayer reconnect/proof flow.
15. The current draft adds an authenticated in-app account-deletion API/UI and cleanup for account directory links, player wallet/session/inventory/transactions, linked Friend data, leaderboard profile data, and associated Play purchase-ledger records. This remains a release gate until latest CI/CodeQL passes, full deletion and retry behavior is tested end-to-end, a public web deletion-request resource is hosted and tested for users who uninstalled the app, and account-associated match receipt/history retention is reviewed.
16. Verify the privacy policy, Data safety declarations, consent/child-directed treatment where applicable, content rating, store listing, internal test track, and support contact.

## Cloudflare

Worker:

```text
ludoproof-game-api
```

Durable Objects:

```text
LUDOPROOF_MATCHES -> MatchRoom
LUDOPROOF_API_GATE -> ApiGate
LUDOPROOF_LEADERBOARD -> LeaderboardRoom
LUDOPROOF_MATCHMAKER -> MatchmakerQueue
LUDOPROOF_FRIENDS -> FriendDirectory
LUDOPROOF_RECEIPTS -> MatchReceiptArchive
LUDOPROOF_TEAM_MATCHMAKER -> TeamMatchmakerQueue
LUDOPROOF_FRIEND_CONVERSATIONS -> FriendConversation
LUDOPROOF_FRIEND_RECENT -> FriendRecentRoom
LUDOPROOF_STORE_PURCHASES -> StorePurchaseLedger
LUDOPROOF_ACCOUNT_DIRECTORY -> AccountDirectory
LUDOPROOF_PLAYER_ACCOUNTS -> PlayerAccount
```

Internal Worker service binding:

```text
ENTRONEX_SERVICE -> entronex-v4-eval
```

Production LudoProof-to-EntroNex traffic uses this Cloudflare Service Binding instead of routing through the public `workers.dev` hostname. The public base URL remains configured as the canonical request URL and as the local/non-Cloudflare fallback.

The rate gate is sharded by a one-way hash of the Cloudflare client IP plus request scope. Raw client IP addresses are not stored in match state or limiter state.

Source-controlled non-secret variables/trust material:

```text
ENTRONEX_BASE_URL=https://entronex-v4-eval.ai-8f3.workers.dev
ENTRONEX_SIGNING_KEY_ID=cf-v4-eval-sign-1
ENTRONEX_TENANT_ID=cloudflare_v4_eval
ENTRONEX_SIGNING_KEY_FINGERPRINT=1fe248e8ee9129fcd13c1ee96c1cd7d162a610e9b1df3037a4ec48935f2d43c4
ENTRONEX_SIGNING_PUBLIC_KEY_PEM_B64=<pinned in server/wrangler.json>
GOOGLE_SIGN_IN_WEB_CLIENT_ID=<configured in Cloudflare Worker; not a secret>
```

The public pin comes from the EntroNex live public-trust export workflow, which recomputes SHA-256 over the Ed25519 SPKI bytes before publishing the bundle.

Required server-only Cloudflare secrets at runtime:

```text
ENTRONEX_API_TOKEN
LUDOPROOF_SESSION_HMAC_KEY
```

The deploy workflow can generate `LUDOPROOF_SESSION_HMAC_KEY` directly in Cloudflare on first deployment and preserves it on later deployments when the operator does not supply a GitHub copy. Never commit, log, paste, or embed either runtime secret in the Android app.

Readiness endpoint:

```text
GET /ready
```

The endpoint fails closed with HTTP 503 until the match-storage and rate-gate bindings, account directory and player-account Durable Objects, the shared Google OAuth Web client ID variable (`GOOGLE_SIGN_IN_WEB_CLIENT_ID`), retry-safe session HMAC key, EntroNex server credential, pinned EntroNex signing identity, and upstream EntroNex health check are all ready. Billing and AdMob rewards are separately gated and should remain disabled until their own end-to-end tests pass.

## Pre-launch account and store notes

The operator confirms there are no production users and no real purchase transactions today. A historic customer/purchase migration is therefore not a blocker for initial launch. New accounts should begin with server-authoritative empty wallet state. Old device-local gem balances, cosmetics progress, and Remove Ads flags remain unverified test/cache data and must not be automatically imported as paid currency or entitlements.

The current draft adds an authenticated `POST /api/account/delete` API and Profile UI confirmation. A public account-deletion page is now authored at `docs/account-deletion.html` with a GitHub Pages workflow (`.github/workflows/account-deletion-pages.yml`) for Google-linked accounts plus a publisher-support route for guest-only cases. The workflow has not been published from this Draft branch. The API derives the account from a valid bearer session instead of accepting a caller-supplied account ID. Server-side cleanup covers the account directory, wallet/session/inventory/transaction rows, purchase-ledger references, linked Friend/social records, and leaderboard profile; deletion tombstones prevent account/recovery IDs from being silently recreated. After server confirmation the app clears account-scoped local profile, wallet, identity, and pending Play-purchase caches.

This is **implemented in the draft but not yet release-verified**. Latest CI/CodeQL must pass; multi-service deletion/retry needs end-to-end tests; a public web deletion-request resource still needs to be hosted and tested for users who uninstalled the app; and account-associated match receipt/history retention still needs an explicit review. Keep [issue #232](https://github.com/rajkumarlahare/ludoproof/issues/232) open until these gates are complete.

Google sign-in requires the same public Web OAuth Client ID in the Android Gradle property and Cloudflare Worker variable `GOOGLE_SIGN_IN_WEB_CLIENT_ID`; do not put an OAuth client secret in Android. The Android package is `com.ludoproof.game`.

The public deletion page source is `docs/account-deletion.html`; the public privacy policy draft is `docs/privacy-policy.html`; and `.github/workflows/account-deletion-pages.yml` publishes both through GitHub Pages only from `main`. The workflow refuses to publish while the policy contains `POLICY_RELEASE_REVIEW_REQUIRED`, before `LUDOPROOF_POLICY_RELEASE_APPROVED=true`, or when the OAuth Client ID, monitored support email, or web origin is missing/invalid. CORS is fail-closed until Cloudflare variable `LUDOPROOF_ACCOUNT_WEB_ORIGIN` is explicitly set to `https://rajkumarlahare.github.io`; there is no fallback origin. The guest-only/uninstalled-app support route is not considered usable until the publisher verifies the support process and the deployed page.

Billing and rewarded ads remain opt-in integrations. Keep billing/ads build flags and server enablement off until the exact Play product catalog/service account and AdMob production unit/SSV callback have passed internal end-to-end tests.

## Android release security

The release candidate:

- blocks cleartext network traffic;
- disables Android backup for local game state;
- encrypts the player bearer token with an Android Keystore AES-GCM key and binds its match/player metadata with GCM AAD;
- encrypts the pending unrevealed client seed with Android Keystore and binds its match/commitment metadata with GCM AAD;
- limits API response size;
- enables release shrinking and resource shrinking;
- runs JVM unit tests and release lint in CI;
- builds release APK/AAB candidates and records SHA-256 evidence in CI;
- refreshes multiplayer state automatically only while the Activity is in the foreground.

The release signing key must be managed outside this repository. Never commit a keystore or signing password. CI artifacts are release candidates, not store-signed production packages; final upload/store signing is an external controlled step.

## Match lifecycle

Waiting and active matches expire after seven days without a game mutation.

Finished matches expire after 24 hours.

Reads do not extend the lifetime. Real game mutations schedule a new Durable Object alarm.

## Randomness invariants

Do not add any of the following:

- anti-repeat logic;
- anti-streak logic;
- recent-result weighting;
- reroll-until-different behavior;
- replacement rolls after network failure;
- client-selected event indexes.

Repeated dice results are valid IID outcomes.

The same logical event is identified by:

```text
applicationId + matchId + eventType + eventIndex
```

A retry must resume the same pending round.

## Offline randomness parity

Offline mode must not use a separate simplified dice path.

The Android offline engine is locked to:

```text
algorithm = entronex-v4-dual-commit-hkdf-sha256-context-bound
outcomes = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
cellsPerOutcome = 16
timelineTicks = 512
epochCount = 8
probeCount = 3
ruleset = ludoproof-standard-v1
```

It must preserve the same v4 commitment prefixes, context/config/event-binding digests, transcript construction, HKDF labels, HMAC stream namespace, 48-bit rejection sampling, balanced Natural World layout, probe motion, logical transforms, witness swap, field/world digests, and proof digest.

A frozen cross-language EntroNex candidate vector is asserted by Android JVM tests. The offline engine must fail closed if local v4 recomputation does not reproduce the generated proof before the outcome is applied.

The trust claim remains narrower than online mode: offline has **algorithmic parity**, not remote authority parity. Both offline seeds are generated on the same device; there is no remote EntroNex signed commitment/proof attestation.
## Ruleset

Current ruleset:

```text
ludoproof-standard-v1
```

Do not silently add blockade/stack behavior or otherwise change gameplay semantics under this ID. A rules change requires a reviewed new ruleset identifier and corresponding tests.

## Cryptographic claim boundary

EntroNex v4 remains an evaluation candidate pending independent cryptographic review.

Therefore the game may describe a roll as mathematically verified against the current EntroNex v4 proof implementation, but must not claim that the system is independently audited, certified, gambling-certified, or production-certified by a third party.

Independent review remains a release requirement for high-assurance or regulated use.


## Automated Cloudflare production deployment

The repository contains a gated production workflow:

```text
.github/workflows/deploy-cloudflare.yml
```

Automatic deployment on a `main` push is disabled unless the GitHub repository/environment variable below is explicitly enabled:

```text
CLOUDFLARE_DEPLOY_ENABLED=true
```

The production GitHub environment needs only one externally supplied secret for a clean first deployment:

```text
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN
```

`ENTRONEX_API_TOKEN` is optional as an operator-supplied synchronized rotation value. When it is absent, the workflow checks the secret names on `entronex-v4-eval` and `ludoproof-game-api`. If both are absent it generates one masked customer credential in GitHub Actions and installs the same value on both Workers after all repository tests and the Wrangler dry-run pass. If both already exist it preserves them. If only one exists, deployment fails closed instead of guessing or silently rotating the trust relationship.

The Cloudflare account ID is non-secret and pinned in the workflow for the existing account. The EntroNex public signing trust is pinned in `server/wrangler.json`. `LUDOPROOF_SESSION_HMAC_KEY` may optionally be supplied as a GitHub secret; otherwise the workflow preserves the existing Cloudflare value or securely generates it on first deployment.

The workflow validates configuration without printing secret values, runs the repository security gate and server tests, performs a Wrangler production dry-run, deploys the Worker, synchronizes or preserves the EntroNex credential, preserves or creates the session HMAC, and only completes successfully after both `/health` and `/ready` pass.

A manual `workflow_dispatch` run is also available. Do not enable continuous deployment until the production environment contains all required values and the pinned EntroNex signing identity has been verified independently.


### EntroNex signing-key rotation

A changed EntroNex signing key must not be accepted automatically. Run the EntroNex `EntroNex v4 Public Trust Export` workflow, verify that its published fingerprint matches the intended Cloudflare evaluation Worker, review the new public key bundle, update the pinned values in `server/wrangler.json`, and let the repository security gate verify the reviewed pin before deployment.


### GitHub-only bootstrap

A local clone is not required for production bootstrap. The workflow can create the first EntroNex evaluation customer token entirely inside GitHub Actions using the production `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`. The generated value is masked before it is written to either Worker and is not uploaded as an artifact or printed to logs.


### EntroNex transport

Production must keep `ENTRONEX_SERVICE -> entronex-v4-eval` configured. Cloudflare Service Bindings invoke the target Worker directly within the same account and remove public `workers.dev` reachability from the production dependency path. Local tests and non-Cloudflare tooling retain the public URL fallback.


### Automated live game smoke

Every production deployment runs `scripts/production-game-smoke.mjs` after `/ready` succeeds. The smoke creates an isolated two-player match through the public production API, joins the second player, starts the match, performs one or more real EntroNex v4 commit/reveal rolls, validates the returned proof contract, and performs a legal move when the sampled dice sequence makes one available.

The smoke never logs player bearer tokens or client seeds. The temporary match follows the normal match-retention policy and expires automatically. A deployment is considered successful only after readiness and this live game-flow smoke both complete.
